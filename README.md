# Web Christmas Tree Project
- Hello :)

## Abstract
- Christmas is coming up and me, being from from an Vietnamese family of which we would never build a Christmas tree, I decided to code a christmas tree and put it on the web.

## Technologies
- The Christmas tree better be 3D so it would actually look cool in the eyes of the normies at school (my classmates).
- I am going to use Three.js. But that would take too much time. So instead, I am going to use Next JS and React Three JS - Fiber. Mainly because I have been doing another project (my personal blog) which uses Next JS.
